# weather

A flutter weather app that uses a web scraper to "borrow?" the data becuase weather API's cost money apparently. 

## Initial commit details

In this initial commit, the app can print the weather data summary to stdo but not on the app. I am still figuring out how to properly borrow the data from the BOM website.
